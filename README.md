# Stress Quantification Using Integrated Datasets (SQUID)

This directory houses code to run SQUID from standalone R code, and also houses the WIP code for an R package to run SQUID. Eventually, the directory will be replaced with only the package code.

Please report any issues running the code, feature requests, etc. in the Issues tab.

SQUID was first published in [Kelley _et al._, 2025](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(25)00063-3).
